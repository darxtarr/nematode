**Reflexive Machine Learning for Systems**

Nematode explores how *tiny, offline-trained models* can replace static heuristics inside performance-critical loops.  
Inspired by the **Kernel Machine Learning (KML)** project from Stony Brook (S. Shankar, A. Zadok et al., 2023â€“25), it extends the idea to user-space and distributed nodes.

## Concept
Train offline for minutes â†’ deploy KB-sized model â†’ run inference in microseconds.

Each reflex observes local telemetry, decides on one or more tunables, and can be swapped or rolled back instantly.

Workload â†’ Telemetry â†’ Offline Trainer â†’ .reflex â†’ Runtime Loader â†’ Apply Decisions â†’ Measure â†’ Repeat

## Why
Static heuristics are guesses.  
A tiny trained model can generalize workload patterns faster than a human tuning cycle, without the cost of a full RL agent or cloud inference.

## Current Focus
- Minimal viable reflex loop.
- Portable telemetry schema.
- Reflex file format (`.reflex`).
- Benchmark harness + plots.

## Status
ðŸŒ± **Experimental.**  Goal: prove that training in minutes can beat fixed heuristics on real workloads.
