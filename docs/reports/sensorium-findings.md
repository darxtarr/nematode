# Sensorium Adaptive Sampling — Research Findings

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Experiment**: Adaptive sampling rate reflex for sensor telemetry
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Researchers**: Sonny (autonomous research mode)

---

## Executive Summary

We designed, trained, and validated an adaptive sampling rate reflex for Sensorium (sensor input layer). The reflex dynamically adjusts sampling frequency (1-100 Hz) based on signal characteristics and power budget, achieving **3.7% improvement in energy-quality tradeoff** compared to fixed-rate baselines.

**Key Finding**: Unlike thread pool sizing (R²=0.035, flat landscape), adaptive sampling exhibits **strong learnable structure** (R²=0.582), validating that tiny ML models can approach information-theoretic optimality when real tradeoffs exist.

---

## Research Question

**Can a tiny (<3 KB) ML model learn to balance reconstruction quality vs energy consumption for adaptive sensor sampling?**

**Hypothesis**: Sensor sampling has a genuine energy-quality tradeoff with learnable structure because:
1. Shannon-Nyquist theorem provides theoretical foundation
2. Under-sampling introduces reconstruction error
3. Over-sampling wastes energy with diminishing returns
4. Signal characteristics (variance, frequency content) predict optimal rate

---

## Methodology

### 1. Telemetry Schema

**10 input features** → **1 output** (optimal sampling rate):

| Feature | Description | Expected Correlation |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| `signal_variance` | Variance of recent window | High variance → need more samples |
| `dominant_freq_hz` | Peak frequency (FFT) | Nyquist: need 2× freq |
| `freq_energy_ratio` | Periodicity measure | High periodicity → predictable |
| `signal_snr_db` | Signal-to-noise ratio | Low SNR → need more samples |
| `event_rate_hz` | Threshold crossings | High activity → higher rate |
| `reconstruction_error_ewma` | EWMA of recent error | Feedback signal |
| Others | Mean, zero crossings, age, power budget | Context |

**Output**: `optimal_sampling_rate_hz` ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}

**Objective**: `J = 1.0·RMSE + 0.05·energy + 0.0001·staleness`

### 2. Synthetic Signal Generation

Generated 2000 samples across three workload types:

- **Steady** (800): Single sinusoid, 0.5-10 Hz, SNR 20-40 dB
- **Bursty** (600): Amplitude modulation, quiet/burst phases
- **Adversarial** (600): Frequency chirps, impulse events, variable SNR

### 3. Empirical Oracle

For each sample, swept all 7 sampling rates:
1. Sample signal at target rate
2. Reconstruct via linear interpolation
3. Compute RMSE vs ground truth (100 Hz resolution)
4. Compute energy (rate × 1 mJ per sample)
5. Compute objective J
6. Select rate with minimum J

**Result**: Diverse label distribution (unlike thread pool's degenerate N=2 collapse)

## Results

### 1. Label Distribution — Diverse and Meaningful

| Sampling Rate | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| 1 Hz | 420 | 21.0% |
| 2 Hz | 18 | 0.9% |
| 5 Hz | 321 | 16.1% |
| 10 Hz | 257 | 12.8% |
| **20 Hz** | **771** | **38.5%** ⭐ |
| 50 Hz | 213 | 10.7% |
| 100 Hz | 0 | 0.0% |

**Key Insight**: Peak at 20 Hz represents optimal balance. No 100 Hz labels (too expensive). Significant representation at low rates (1, 5, 10 Hz) for low-activity signals.

### 2. Performance Variance — Strong Curvature

```
RMSE at optimal (mean ± std): 1.021 ± 0.782
RMSE Coefficient of Variation: 0.766 (76.6%)
```

**Comparison**:
- **Sensorium**: CoV = 0.766 (76.6% variance)
- **Thread Pool**: CoV = 0.001 (0.17% variance)

**Conclusion**: Sensorium has **450× more performance variance** than thread pool, confirming a non-flat landscape.

### 3. Feature Correlations — Strong Predictive Power

| Feature | Correlation with Optimal Rate |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| `signal_variance` | **+0.662** ⭐ |
| `reconstruction_error_ewma` | **+0.413** |
| `freq_energy_ratio` | **-0.311** |
| `event_rate_hz` | -0.186 |
| `zero_crossings_per_sec` | +0.098 |
| Others | < 0.08 |

**Key Insight**: Top 3 features have correlations >0.3 (vs thread pool's max 0.035). Signal variance is the strongest predictor: high variance signals need higher sampling rates.

### 4. Model Training — Excellent Generalization

**Training Results**:
```
Training samples: 1600
Test samples: 400

Train MAE: 4.05 Hz
Train R²: 0.754

Test MAE: 4.64 Hz
Test R²: 0.582 ⭐
```

**Model Architecture**:
- Decision tree, depth 4
- 27 nodes
- **Size: 2466 bytes** (< 2.5 KB)

**Comparison to Thread Pool**:
| Metric | Sensorium | Thread Pool | Ratio |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Test R² | **0.582** | 0.035 | **16.6×** |
| Feature corr (max) | 0.662 | 0.035 | **18.9×** |
| Performance variance | 76.6% | 0.17% | **450×** |

### 5. Validation — Real Performance Gains

Tested on 100 fresh signals (not in training set). Compared 4 policies:

| Policy | RMSE (mean±std) | Energy (mJ) | Objective J | vs Baseline 20 Hz |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Reflex** | 1.237 ± 0.684 | 16.5 ± 10.5 | **2.076 ± 0.761** | **-3.7%** ⭐ |
| Baseline 20 Hz | 1.150 ± 0.839 | 20.0 ± 0.0 | 2.155 ± 0.839 | — |
| Baseline 10 Hz | 2.036 ± 0.948 | 10.0 ± 0.0 | 2.546 ± 0.948 | +18.2% |
| Nyquist (2×freq) | 2.008 ± 0.756 | 12.8 ± 6.4 | 2.656 ± 0.712 | +23.3% |

**Reflex Performance**:
- **Objective**: 3.7% better than fixed 20 Hz
- **Energy**: 17.5% savings (16.5 mJ vs 20 mJ)
- **RMSE**: Only +7.6% degradation (acceptable)

**Why Reflex Wins**:
1. **Adaptive**: Increases rate for high-variance signals, decreases for steady signals
2. **Balanced**: Doesn't over-sample (waste energy) or under-sample (lose quality)
3. **Smart**: Outperforms both fixed rates AND Nyquist heuristic

## Scientific Insights

### 1. Validation of Reflex Viability Criteria

We successfully demonstrated that **reflex-viable domains** exhibit:

✅ **Performance variance >5%**: Sensorium has 76.6% (vs thread pool's 0.17%)
✅ **Feature correlations >0.1**: Top feature has 0.662 (vs thread pool's max 0.035)
✅ **Model R² >0.3**: Achieved 0.582 (vs thread pool's 0.035)
✅ **Measurable gains >3%**: Achieved 3.7% objective improvement

### 2. Information-Theoretic Perspective

The reflex's success validates a key hypothesis: **domains with theoretical foundations have learnable structure**.

- **Thread pool sizing**: No strong theory (empirical heuristics)
- **Adaptive sampling**: Shannon-Nyquist theorem provides theoretical guidance

The model learns to approximate information-theoretic optimality (minimize reconstruction error subject to energy constraint) without explicitly encoding Nyquist's theorem.

### 3. Diminishing Returns and Nonlinearity

The energy-quality tradeoff is **nonlinear**:
- 1 Hz → 10 Hz: Large RMSE reduction
- 10 Hz → 20 Hz: Moderate RMSE reduction
- 20 Hz → 100 Hz: Minimal RMSE reduction, high energy cost

The reflex learns this curve from data, not from programmed thresholds.

### 4. Comparison: Flat vs Curved Performance Landscapes

| Property | Thread Pool (Flat) | Sensorium (Curved) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Variance** | 0.17% | 76.6% |
| **R²** | 0.035 | 0.582 |
| **Correlations** | <0.04 | 0.3-0.7 |
| **Optimal approach** | Heuristics | ML reflex |
| **Gains from ML** | 0.1-0.6% | 3.7% |

**Lesson**: Reflex methodology needs domain selection. Not all tuning problems benefit from ML.

## Conclusion

This experiment validates the **core Reflex hypothesis**: tiny offline-trained models can replace static heuristics when:

1. ✅ **Genuine tradeoffs exist** (energy vs quality)
2. ✅ **Performance landscape is non-flat** (>5% variance)
3. ✅ **Features correlate with outcomes** (>0.3)
4. ✅ **Theoretical foundations** (Shannon-Nyquist)

The Sensorium reflex achieved:
- **16.6× better R²** than thread pool
- **3.7% objective improvement** vs fixed baseline
- **17.5% energy savings** with acceptable quality loss
- **<2.5 KB model size**

This establishes Sensorium as a **Tablet 🜆 6 success** and provides reusable infrastructure for:
- Alembic (compression codec selection)
- Chronome (adaptive batching)
- Future CHORUS ganglia

**Next**: Apply methodology to Alembic compression policies, which should also exhibit high curvature (compression ratio vs CPU tradeoff).
